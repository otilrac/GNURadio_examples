# GNURadio_examples
8DPSK / D8PSK / 8PSK working examples in GNURadio. Will also add a 9PSK / 9DPSK / 8DPSK-with-nulls example, and some others.

I couldn't find any working example of 8PSK or 8DPSK nor anyone who could help, and GNURadio documentation was worthless. After a great deal of struggle and months of tinkering I have some solid designs, and though I would share them to save others months of frustration. I plan to add some other examples as well.
